<h1> Orlando Galleria/Galleria Orlando - Orlando, FL </h1>
<p>Plans for a 1.5 million square foot, 4-5 anchor mall named Galleria Orlando were first announced in 1984 as a joint venture of the Prudential Insurance Co. of America and Major Realty Corp, with plans to open in late 1986. The first major tenant to commit was AMC, who announced plans to open a 16-screen theater at the development, which had then been pushed back to a 1988 opening.

<br>
By January 1987, the developers, now references as "Major-Pru Squitieri", claimed development on the now 6 anchor, 200 store mall would begin late that year. However, by 1989 only Ivey's had committed to the project, with construction post-poned until at least 3 anchors could be secured. Nordstrom also reportedly expressed interest in the property around 1990, but pulled out shortly thereafter. In May 1996, Simon officials attending the annual International Council of Shopping Centers convention stressed that the project was "still kicking around... but nothing will be built soon".

By October 1996, the project, now relocated to an undisclosed "former Palmetto patch" after the original site became the home of Universal Studios' Islands Of Adventure, was named as a joint venture between the Simon Debartolo Group and Schrimsher Southwest, with Nordstrom again expressing interest in the project. However, this is the last that the project ever appears in the news press, and  as such it was presumably scrapped for good shortly thereafter.</p>
