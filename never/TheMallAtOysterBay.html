<h1> Mall At Oyster Bay </h1>
<p> The Mall At Oyster Bay was a $500 million project to build a new 860,000 sq ft mall anchored by, at varying times, Lord & Taylor, Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, and Barneys New York in the town of Syosset, NY, on Long Island. The mall, first proposed in 1994, was to be built on the former Cerro Wire and Cable Company site by Taubman. However, the mall was met with harsh local resistance- by 2000, opponents included 20 civic associations, 2 school boards, and the Nassau County Chambers of Commerce. The plan soldiered on however- pushed back a little bit every time.

In 2002, the city rejected Taubman's plans, however Taubman filed a successful lawsuit over this decision, saying that the town board had acted in a "arbitrary and capricious manner". By 2005, when Nordstrom got on board, the opening had been pushed to Fall 2007. Even into the 2010s, Taubman still had intentions to open the mall. Finally, in 2014, after Taubman had reportedly dumped more than $180 million into the property, it was sold to Simon Property Group in a $230 million dollar deal that also included Taubman's interest in the Arizona Mills mall. Simon said it intended to develop the property into a mixed use development, with limited retail, which appears to have occurred.</p>
