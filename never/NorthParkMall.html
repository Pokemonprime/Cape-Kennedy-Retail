The North Park Mall was announced in 1966, sitting on a 175-acre site at the corner of I-75 and Pierson. Designed by architect Louis G. Redstone with estimated costs of $30 million (just under $239 million today), anchors were never announced, though the concept drawing shows 2-3 anchors, with one that resembles JM Fields.
<br>
Little else is known about the mall- it disappears from newspapers after it's 1955 announcement.
