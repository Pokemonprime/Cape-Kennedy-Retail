<h1> Battle Creek Square Mall </h1>

<p> A joint venture by Jacobs, Visconsi, and Jacobs and Dayton-Hudson Properties, Battle Creek Square Mall was to be an 800,000 sq ft, 4-anchor mall to rival the then newly-proposed Lakeview Square Mall (which was actually built). It was announced in the June 15, 1980 issue of the Battle Creek Enquirer with a nearly full page ad entitled "Battle Creek Square Mall Good For Battle Creek- Good For You!", which featured a rendering of the mall from the air as well as a site development plan.</p>

<p> The mall, set for a 1983 opening, was unaffected by Dayton-Hudson's sale of it's stake to Center Cos. However, the mall was none the less canned by 1982, when the land was re-zoned for other uses.</p>
