<h1> Keystone Crossing Mall </h1>
<p> Keystone Crossing Mall was to be a 1.3 million square foot destination, dubbed a "shoppertainment" mall with outparcels including restaurants, a movie theater, discount stores, and a 125-room hotel in the town of Uwchlan Township, Pennsylvania. While first pitched in 1995 by "Kravco"; that iteration of the project never went far, and the focus here will be the Taubman incarnation, first revealed in March 1998. However, the mall met with severe backlash from locals, over fears of the cost to the township, the hiring of new police, congestion on an already clogged road, and more.

By December 1998, plans for the mall had been formally canceled. </p>
