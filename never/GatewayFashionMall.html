<p> The Gateway Fashion Mall was one of many aborted LJ Hooker projects, this one in Atlanta. Announced in 1988, like many failed malls of the era it was a massive project. 150 interior shops, a food court, a movie theater, an arts theater, four to six anchors, all housed in 1.2 million square feet and three floors. Plans also included two office buildings, 21 and 49 stories respectively. The development was to be located between Peachtree and W Peachtree Street- the closest landmarks that exist today are the Midtown MARTA Station, the Southern Company Gas building at 10 Peachtree Pl NE (which was built as the LJ Hooker headquarters, and is the only existant piece of this development as far as I can tell), and the 999 Peachtree Building.

Tenants were never officially announced for the mall, though it was mentioned that Rich's was a potential anchor before their acquisition by Campeau Corp. The mall's design was done by Thompson, Ventulett Stainback & Associates; it was described as "glass-covered" and was to feature "a glass dome atop a rotunda with a grand staircase." and "sculpted columns and chandeliers" in the interior.</p>
