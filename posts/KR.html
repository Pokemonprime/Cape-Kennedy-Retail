<h1> Kids R Us signs </h1>

<p> On the night of September 13th, 2019 driving past the former Melbourne Toys R Us, I noticed it seemed like that Spirit Halloween's banner was flat against the building, instead of stretched over signage. I returned the next day to find that the signage had been taken down! However, I had a feeling... so, I drove around back and... </p>

<p> I found a pile of letters where the dumpsters had once resided! The big letters still had their fronts, but they were massively heavy and most importantly too big to fit in the car. The smaller letters, from the Kids R Us sign, were lighter and easier to handle, however they were missing their fronts. I checked for them, couldn't find them anywhere. I plan to see if I can get new ones made from, I don't know, colored plexiglass? </p>

<p> This is what I walked away with- a "K" for it's my first initial and a letter unique to the "Kids R Us" signage, and I took the "R" just cause it was iconic. A few days later I returned to maybe get more, but by this time they were all gone, likely to the great scrapyard in the sky. </p>

<p> AND THEY LIVE! Some cable and plugs from Home Depot later, these guys lit right up like Christmas trees. They conveniently had switches right on each letter. I have yet to get fronts made for them, but they now are wired up again, and they've been moved inside, sheltered from the harsh weather. These are hopefully just the first members of what will be an extensive sign collection. </p>
